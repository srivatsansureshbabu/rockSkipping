# ðŸŒŠ Rock Skipping

Rock Skipping is a fun little **rock skipping simulator** created by me and my friend.  
We love skipping rocks on the beach, so we decided to make a simple game about it!

---

## ðŸŽ® What is it?

This project simulates throwing a rock into water, letting you move around and skip rocks virtually â€” just like at the beach.

We built it for fun as a light-hearted project to work on together.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
